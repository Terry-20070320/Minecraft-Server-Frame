# Minecaft-Server-Frame
This is a Minecraft server setup framework that can help beginners quickly deploy their own private servers. I will gradually update all versions, but please give me some time.

If you are a complete beginner before you start using it, please be sure to read my instructions below.
This framework contains the most basic components for the server to function. If you need to install mods or plugins, please be sure to download the versions you require.

Full Vanilla Experience: Vanilla.
Requires Plugin: Spigot.
Requires Mods: Not yet updated, please wait patiently.

As for how to connect to the server, I will update this later due to time constraints. There are many related resources on YouTube, so please make good use of them.

Please download from the release.
